 blanks in a story, before reading the – often comical or nonsensical
  – story aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as

Our program is a command terminal version of the mad lib game. The user
will initially be welcomed to the game and then prompted for multiple
word types such as nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Once each
word type has been given by the user, they are strategically placed in
a pre-written mad lib and returned as a customized story.
